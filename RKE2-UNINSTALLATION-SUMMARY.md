#### **All Nodes (mgmt01, worker01, worker02):**
- ✅ **RKE2 Services** - Stopped and disabled completely
- ✅ **RKE2 Binaries** - All executables removed (/usr/local/bin/rke2, kubectl, etc.)
- ✅ **Data Directories** - All cluster data cleaned (/var/lib/rancher/rke2, /etc/rancher/rke2)

📁 RKE2 Files: Only /etc/rancher/node/password (harmless leftover)
🌐 Network Interfaces: No RKE2 network interfaces found
🔄 Reboot Status: All nodes rebooted for clean state
```

### 🔧 **Cleanup Process Details:**

#### **Phase 1: Service Shutdown**
- Stopped rke2-server on master node
- Stopped rke2-agent on worker nodes
- Verified all services inactive

#### **Phase 2: Data Removal**
- Removed /var/lib/rancher/rke2 (cluster data)
- Removed /etc/rancher/rke2 (configurations)
- Removed /var/lib/kubelet (kubernetes data)
- Removed /root/.kube (kubectl configs)
- Cleaned container runtime directories

#### **Phase 3: Binary Cleanup**
- Removed /usr/local/bin/rke2
- Removed /usr/local/bin/kubectl
- Removed rke2-killall.sh and rke2-uninstall.sh
- Cleaned installation scripts

#### **Phase 4: System Cleanup**
- Removed systemd service files
- Killed remaining processes forcefully
- Unmounted RKE2 filesystem mounts
- Cleaned network interfaces
- Reset failed systemd units
- Cleared package manager cache

#### **Phase 5: Reboot & Verification**
- Rebooted all nodes for clean state
- Verified complete removal
- Confirmed readiness for fresh installation

### 🎯 **Verification Results:**

#### **Cluster Access:**
```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
✅ Cluster completely removed - kubectl access no longer works
```

#### **Service Status:**
```bash
$ systemctl status rke2-server
✅ RKE2 server service removed

$ systemctl status rke2-agent  
✅ RKE2 agent service removed from worker01
✅ RKE2 agent service removed from worker02
```

#### **Node Status:**
- **mgmt01**: ✅ Clean, rebooted, ready
- **worker01**: ✅ Clean, rebooted, ready  
- **worker02**: ✅ Clean, rebooted, ready

### 🚀 **Current State:**

#### **All Nodes Are:**
- ✅ **Completely clean** - No RKE2 components remaining
- ✅ **Freshly rebooted** - Clean system state
- ✅ **SSH accessible** - Remote management working
- ✅ **Ready for use** - Can install new services or RKE2

#### **What's Preserved:**
- ✅ **SSH configuration** - Remote access maintained
- ✅ **Network settings** - Basic connectivity intact
- ✅ **User accounts** - User data and home directories
- ✅ **System packages** - Core Ubuntu packages unchanged
- ✅ **Ansible inventory** - Automation framework ready

### 💡 **Next Steps Options:**

#### **Option 1: Fresh RKE2 Installation**
```bash
# Use the merged Ubuntu default role
ansible-playbook -i inventory complete-installation-runbook.yml --tags rke2

# Or full installation with all components
ansible-playbook -i inventory complete-installation-runbook.yml
```

#### **Option 2: Different Kubernetes Distribution**
- Install K3s for lightweight setup
- Install kubeadm for vanilla Kubernetes
- Install kind/minikube for development

#### **Option 3: Alternative Use**
- Use nodes for other applications
- Install Docker/Podman for containers
- Set up as development environment

### ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

#### **Security:**
- All cluster certificates and keys have been removed
- Fresh installation will generate new certificates
- Previous kubectl configurations are invalid

#### **Data:**
- All Kubernetes workloads and data have been removed
- No persistent volumes remain from RKE2
- Clean slate for new deployments

#### **Network:**
- All CNI components removed
- Standard Ubuntu networking restored
- Ready for new network configurations

## 🎉 **Summary**

The RKE2 cluster has been **completely and safely uninstalled** from all three nodes:
- **mgmt01** (192.168.1.141) - Former master node
- **worker01** (192.168.1.142) - Former worker node  
- **worker02** (192.168.1.145) - Former worker node

All nodes are now in a **clean state**, **freshly rebooted**, and **ready for whatever comes next**! 🚀

The uninstallation was comprehensive, removing all RKE2 components while preserving system integrity and SSH access for continued management.
