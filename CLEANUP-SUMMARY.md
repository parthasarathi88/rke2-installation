# Standalone Files Cleanup - Complete

## 🧹 **Cleanup Summary**

Successfully removed standalone Ubuntu RKE2 installation files since functionality has been merged into the RKE2 role.

### ❌ **Files Removed:**
- `ubuntu-apt-rke2-install.yml` - APT-based installation attempt
- `ubuntu-default-rke2-install.yml` - Official script installation
- `test-rke2-role.yml` - Role testing playbook

### ✅ **Files Remaining:**
- `complete-installation-runbook.yml` - **Main deployment playbook**
- `remove-rke2.yml` - Cluster cleanup playbook

### 🎯 **Reason for Removal:**
These standalone files were experimental approaches that have now been successfully **merged into the RKE2 role** (`roles/rke2/tasks/main.yml`). The role-based approach provides:

- **Better organization** - Code is properly structured in roles
- **Reusability** - Can be used across different playbooks
- **Maintainability** - Single source of truth for RKE2 installation
- **Integration** - Works seamlessly with other roles

### 🚀 **Current Project Structure:**

└── templates/                         # 📄 Configuration files
```

### 💡 **Usage:**
The Ubuntu default RKE2 installation is now available through the main playbook:

```bash
# Full installation
ansible-playbook -i inventory complete-installation-runbook.yml

# RKE2 only
ansible-playbook -i inventory complete-installation-runbook.yml --tags rke2

# Cleanup
ansible-playbook -i inventory remove-rke2.yml
```

### ✅ **Benefits of Cleanup:**
- **Reduced complexity** - Fewer files to maintain
- **Clear structure** - Role-based organization
- **No duplication** - Single implementation approach
- **Better documentation** - Focused on main playbooks

The project is now **cleaner and more focused** with the Ubuntu default RKE2 method properly integrated into the role structure! 🎉
